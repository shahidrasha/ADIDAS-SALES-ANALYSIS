# ADIDAS-SALES-ANALYSIS
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Adidas sales data to gain actionable insights into sales performance, profitability, and trends across different regions and product categories.

Analysis: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks that process the raw data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate insights via visualizations.
Visualizations: Charts and graphs created using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly, illustrating key trends in sales, profitability, and product performance.
Reports: Summarized findings based on the analysis, including recommendations for improving sales, identifying profitable product categories, and optimizing the sales strategy.
